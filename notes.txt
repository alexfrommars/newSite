RVM and Bundler are not communicating well, probably due to me using homebrew to run the latest version of Ruby in this project.
Some command line tools we need to check:
echo GEM_PATH=$GEM_PATH
echo PATH=$PATH
May need to configure shell for rbenv: echo 'eval "$(~/.rbenv/bin/rbenv init - zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
Okay got that, now remember the steps to launch the site for testing:
make sure Bundler is updated, gem install bundler
and then in the terminal: 'bundle exec jekyll serve', followed by:  'bundle exec jekyll build'

When using Bundler to manage gems youâ€™ll want to run Jekyll using bundle exec jekyll serve and bundle exec jekyll build.

Example Gemfile:
source "https://rubygems.org"

# Hello! This is where you manage which Jekyll version is used to run.
# When you want to use a different version, change it below, save the
# file and run `bundle install`. Run Jekyll with `bundle exec`, like so:
#
#     bundle exec jekyll serve
#
# This will help ensure the proper Jekyll version is running.
# Happy Jekylling!

# gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins

# To upgrade, run `bundle update`.

gem "jekyll"
gem "minimal-mistakes-jekyll"

# The following plugins are automatically loaded by the theme-gem:
#   gem "jekyll-paginate"
#   gem "jekyll-sitemap"
#   gem "jekyll-gist"
#   gem "jekyll-feed"
#   gem "jekyll-include-cache"
#
# If you have any other plugins, put them here!
# Cf. https://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/installation/
group :jekyll_plugins do
end

Run npm install, if this fails check  node -v
To modify or add your own scripts include them in assets/js/_main.js and then rebuild using npm run build:js. 

If you add additional scripts to assets/js/plugins/ and would like them concatenated with the others, be sure to update the uglify script in package.json.
Same goes for scripts that you remove

Configuration notes: 
to create a page, create a mardown file with the page name, add a.yaml file to _data. make sure to add any neccessary YAML front matter
You need both the md and the yaml. You can also work with the index.html to change the main frontpage,
 consider writing a new page layout adn add it to _layouts
