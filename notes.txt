RVM and Bundler are not communicating well, probably due to me using homebrew to run the latest version of Ruby in this project.
Some command line tools we need to check:
echo GEM_PATH=$GEM_PATH
echo PATH=$PATH

Okay got that, now remember the steps to launch the site for testing:
make sure Bundler is updated, and then in the terminal: bundle exec jekyll serve
